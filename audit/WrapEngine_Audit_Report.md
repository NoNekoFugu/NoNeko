# üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL AUDIT: NoNeko Wrap Engine v1.2  
**Date:** 2025-10-23  

---

## üì¶ OVERALL STRUCTURE

**Contract Name:** `WrapEngine`  
**Language & Compiler:** Solidity ^0.8.20  
**Framework:** OpenZeppelin  

**Imports:**
- SafeERC20 ‚Äî secure ERC20 interaction  
- ReentrancyGuard ‚Äî prevents reentrancy  
- Ownable ‚Äî adds DAO or admin-controlled recovery  

**Purpose:**  
WrapEngine v1.2 is a refined, secure upgrade of the original NoNeko Wrap Engine.  
It wraps arbitrary ERC20 tokens safely, supports deflationary or fee-on-transfer tokens,  
and includes a governance-based recovery mechanism for non-user assets.

## üîç BLOCK-BY-BLOCK ANALYSIS

### State Variables
- `mapping(address => uint256) public totalWrapped`  
- `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public userBalances`

**Pros**
- Clear separation between token totals and user balances.  
- Public mappings enable on-chain transparency.  

**Cons**
- None significant; implementation is clean and follows standards.  

**Rating:** A+

---

### Function: `wrap()`
- Validates non-zero token and ensures contract code exists.  
- Uses SafeERC20 for safe transfer.  
- Handles deflationary tokens by comparing before/after balances.  
- Emits detailed event with amountIn and received.  

**Cons**
- Minimal rounding drift possible for exotic ERC20s with internal burns.  

**Rating:** A

---

### Function: `unwrap()`
- Requires sufficient user balance.  
- Uses SafeERC20 for secure token transfer.  
- Protected by nonReentrant modifier.  
- Emits detailed `Unwrapped` event.  

**Cons**
- None identified.  

**Rating:** A+

---

### Function: `balanceOf()`
- Read-only, transparent, gas-efficient.  

**Rating:** A+

---

### Function: `recover()`
- Restricted to onlyOwner (DAO or multisig recommended).  
- Automatically excludes user funds from recovery.  
- Emits event for traceability.  

**Cons**
- Owner role can still act maliciously if private key compromised.  
- Should be combined with timelock or DAO governance.  

**Rating:** A-

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VULNERABILITIES

| ID | Issue | Risk | Recommendation |
|----|--------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Owner Governance Centralization | Medium | Deploy contract under a DAO or timelocked multisig |
| 2 | Deflationary / Fee-on-Transfer Token Variance | Low | Accounting handles most cases; no fix required |
| 3 | Event Indexing | Low | Index `to` parameter in `Recovered` event for analytics |

## ‚úÖ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

WrapEngine v1.2 is **production-ready** and **security-compliant**.  
All major issues from earlier versions have been fixed:

‚úÖ SafeERC20 integrated  
‚úÖ Token validation added  
‚úÖ Deflationary token logic supported  
‚úÖ Recovery mechanism added  
‚úÖ Reentrancy protection retained  

**Deployment Recommendations:**
- Deploy via multisig or DAO-controlled timelock.  
- Ensure owner is not an EOA.  
- Optionally add indexed events for analytics.  

**Overall Rating:** üü© **A (Secure and Production-Ready)**
