🛠️ TECHNICAL AUDIT: NekoDAO (signal-only governance) v1.1.1  
Date: 2025-10-23

===============================
📦 OVERALL STRUCTURE

**Purpose:**  
NekoDAO v1.1.1 is a minimal, **signal-only** governance system designed to record community intent on-chain without executing or transferring tokens.  
All financial or operational actions are handled externally (e.g., via *NekoSafe*).  

**Core Architecture Updates (vs v1.1):**
- ✅ `cancel()` restricted to **before voting starts** and only when **not paused** (prevents censorship).  
- ✅ `finalize()` callable **even when paused** (prevents governance deadlocks).  
- ✅ **Title/description length limits** and **proposal cooldown per address** added (spam mitigation).  
- ✅ Governance parameter changes now **two-step** (`proposeParams()` → `applyParams()` after delay).  
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `ReentrancyGuard`.  
- ✅ Indexed `ref` field for efficient off-chain analytics.  

**Imports:**  
- `Ownable` — admin control over parameters, pause, and meta-delays.  
- `Pausable` — circuit breaker for voting/creation, *not* for finalize.  

**Storage Model:**
- `Proposal` struct with bounded strings and contextual metadata.  
- `PendingParams` struct for delayed parameter application.  
- Mappings:
  - `hasVoted[proposal][voter]`
  - `lastProposedAt[address]` — per-address cooldown.  

**Governance Logic:**
- One-address-one-vote (no delegation, no quorum).  
- Simple majority rule (`forVotes > againstVotes`).  
- Transparent events for full off-chain indexing.

===============================
🔍 BLOCK-BY-BLOCK ANALYSIS

▶️ **Admin Controls and Parameter Management**

✅ **Pros:**
- Two-step parameter update process with time delay prevents sudden rule changes.  
- Strict min/max bounds for all timing parameters (`votingDelay`, `votingPeriod`, `execCooldown`).  
- Meta-delays (`paramsChangeDelay`, `proposalCooldown`) adjustable within safe bounds (1h–7d).  

❌ **Cons:**
- `onlyOwner` still retains unilateral control to pause/unpause and propose parameters.  
- Governance itself cannot ratify or veto parameter changes yet.  

🧮 **Rating:** A (Security) / B+ (Decentralization)

---

▶️ **Proposal Creation**

✅ **Pros:**
- Anti-spam measures introduced:
  - Title ≤ 96 chars, Description ≤ 2048 chars.
  - Per-address cooldown (`proposalCooldown`, default 10 min).  
- Clean event emission with indexed `ref` for IPFS/commit referencing.  
- Timestamp-based scheduling computed deterministically (`created + votingDelay + votingPeriod`).  

❌ **Cons:**
- No economic fee/deposit mechanism (still possible spam if cooldown is low).  
- Unbounded number of proposals over time → eventual state growth.  

🧮 **Rating:** A−

---

▶️ **Voting**

✅ **Pros:**
- One-vote-per-address enforced (`hasVoted`).  
- Votes can only be cast during valid window `[startAt, endAt)`.  
- Enumeration via `Choice` prevents invalid value injection.  

❌ **Cons:**
- 1-address-1-vote remains Sybil-prone by design (acceptable trade-off).  
- No quorum requirement may still allow small group dominance.  

🧮 **Rating:** A−

---

▶️ **Finalization**

✅ **Pros:**
- Can be called by anyone — inclusive design.  
- Works **even if contract paused**, ensuring proposals cannot be frozen.  
- Deterministic resolution (`passed = forVotes > againstVotes`).  
- Emits full vote breakdown.  

❌ **Cons:**
- None material. Clean, gas-efficient implementation.  

🧮 **Rating:** A

---

▶️ **Cancelation**

✅ **Pros:**
- Can only be called **before voting starts**.  
- Requires contract to be **unpaused**, eliminating mid-vote censorship.  
- Proper event emission (`Canceled`).  

❌ **Cons:**
- Owner still retains full pre-vote control (centralized governance parameter).  

🧮 **Rating:** A (Security) / B (Decentralization)

---

▶️ **Views / Read Functions**

✅ **Pros:**
- Full proposal retrieval via `getProposal()`.  
- `currentTime()` utility supports off-chain synchronization.  
- Read-only architecture; no mutable exposure.  

🧮 **Rating:** A+

===============================
⚠️ VULNERABILITIES

1. **Centralized Ownership (Governance Risk)** — *Medium*  
   - `onlyOwner` controls pausing, parameter proposals, and cancelations.  
   - DAO cannot modify parameters or rotate ownership autonomously.  
   **Recommendation:**  
   - Migrate to **multisig** or **DAO-owned role** (`Ownable2Step` / `AccessControl`).  
   - Optionally require **DAO proposal approval** before parameter application.

2. **Potential Long-Term State Growth** — *Low*  
   - Even with cooldown, users can produce many proposals over time.  
   **Recommendation:**  
   - Introduce optional **proposal cleanup** mechanism or **archival** to off-chain storage.

3. **Sybil Vulnerability (Design-Inherent)** — *Low*  
   - One-address-one-vote is susceptible to identity spam.  
   **Recommendation:**  
   - Keep design philosophy but consider optional proof-of-personhood (e.g., via zkAttestations) for higher-trust deployments.

4. **Owner Still Controls `pause()` and `unpause()`** — *Informational*  
   - While `pause()` can’t block finalization, it can prevent new proposals/votes.  
   **Recommendation:**  
   - Optionally restrict pause duration or make it multisig-controlled.

===============================
🧪 STANDARD CHECKLISTS (MAPPING)

**OpenZeppelin Standards:**  
- ✅ `Ownable` used properly (v5 syntax).  
- ✅ `Pausable` integrated safely with voting/finalization logic.  
- ✅ Safe math (Solidity ^0.8.20).  
- ✅ No external calls or low-level calls.  

**SC-SVS / EthTrust Conformance:**  
- ✅ Role Management: `onlyOwner` clearly defined; no privileged mint/drain.  
- ✅ Event Coverage: Comprehensive for all state transitions.  
- ✅ Resource Management: Bounded input fields, anti-spam timer.  
- ✅ Timestamp Usage: Safe scheduling logic, no predictable manipulation risk.  

**SWC References:**  
- SWC-100 (Function default visibility) — N/A.  
- SWC-105 (Unprotected Ether withdrawal) — N/A.  
- SWC-113 (DoS with large data) — Mitigated by length bounds.  
- SWC-132 (Unexpected revert) — None possible.  
- SWC-107 (Reentrancy) — Not applicable; removed guard safely.

===============================
🔐 ADMIN PRIVILEGE CHECK

- **Can owner drain funds?** ❌ No. Contract holds no Ether or tokens.  
- **Can owner mint or transfer tokens?** ❌ No mint/burn/transfer functions exist.  
- **Can owner disrupt governance?** ⚠️ Yes, temporarily via `pause()`, but cannot censor results or finalize votes early.  

**Status:** Acceptable risk for a signal-only DAO.

===============================
📊 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

| Category | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Code Security | **A** | Clean logic, strong bounds, no reentrancy surface. |
| Decentralization | **B+** | Single owner; fair design improvements reduce abuse. |
| Anti-Spam & UX | **A−** | Cooldown + length limits are strong; deposit optional. |
| Maintainability | **A** | Modular and well-documented. |
| Governance Integrity | **A−** | cancel/finalize logic robust; censorship minimized. |

===============================
✅ **SUMMARY VERDICT**

**NekoDAO v1.1.1** represents a **mature, safe iteration** of the prior version — moving from a centralized but simple governance design to a *minimally hardened and fairness-oriented* model.  

It is now:  
- 🟢 **Censorship-resistant** (cancel only pre-vote).  
- 🟢 **Deadlock-proof** (finalize works during pause).  
- 🟢 **Spam-mitigated** (bounds + cooldown).  
- 🟢 **Parameter-stabilized** (two-step apply).  

**Final Rating:**  
**✅ SECURITY GRADE: A**  
**⚖️ DECENTRALIZATION GRADE: B+**  
**OVERALL ASSESSMENT: STRONG / PRODUCTION-READY (Signal-Only Governance)**  

**Recommendations for v1.2:**  
- Introduce DAO-controlled parameter ratification.  
- Add optional deposit-based proposal system.  
- Enable ownership transfer to community multisig.
